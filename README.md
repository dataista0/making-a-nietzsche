# Making a Nietzsche

This project is a personal research on language models, which I'm structuring as a series of self contained notebooks replaying a day of research in NLP topics with the intention of creating a good Nietzsche-like bot.

Current notebooks:
* [Making a Nietzsche - 1. Research Journal & ULMFit](nbs/Making%20a%20Nietzsche%20-%201.%20Research%20Journal%20%26%20ULMFit.ipynb)
* [GPT-2 - Large (774M params) with Pytorch: Not that impressive](nbs/GPT2-Large%20-774M-%20with%20Pytorch%20-%20Not%20that%20impressive.ipynb)
