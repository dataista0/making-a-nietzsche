    "# GPT-2 Large ⁠–774M params– with Pytorch: Not that impressive\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Update October, 21th: Migrated code to [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)._\n",
    "\n",
    "# This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will apply the out-of-the-box GPT-2 models (`gpt2`, `gpt2-medium` and the recently-released and ported `gpt2-large`) o the samples in the original blog post ([Better Language Models and Their Implications](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)) using `huggingface`'s [pytorch-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) library, with a pretty simple code based on the library's [Quick Start](https://huggingface.co/pytorch-transformers/quickstart.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to write a concise and legible set of functions in order to make it easy to play a little with these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are good but not impressive: they are not consistent throughout and they enter some trivial loops. This may respond to a series of causes. First of all, the recently released large model has only 774M parameters, while the one used to generate the examples (and which has not yet been released yet) has roughly the double. Also, our proof of concept –this notebook– lacks some basic tweaks that may improve the results. Moreover, we are using a deterministic version of the generation, picking always the best prediction instead of using top-k truncated sampling and manually cherry-picking the best one, as is explicitly mentioned in their article:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note that while we have hand-chosen these samples, and are thus engaging in some meta-cherry-picking, we believe they are not too unrepresentative of the sampling process. We are simply using top-k truncated sampling, and have yet to explore more advanced methods of sampling (such as beam-search methods). ↩︎\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: We added two simple post-processing steps which seem fair to be added to this first experiment, although this breaks the out-of-the-box spirit. We are removing repeated sentences as well as the last incomplete sentence of the generated text (if any). This significantly improves the impact of the results._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next?\n",
    "This is a one-shot out-of-the-box experiment, which proved too difficult, to be fair. We are currently writing a follow-up, more friendly experiment environment, with some simple post-processing steps and a manual cherry-picking of the best result out of a set of generated ones. The partial results generated in this friendlier experiment are much better than the ones shown here, but still not that terrifying. You can check the unfinished notebook (with all the outputs already generated) [here](https://github.com/dataista0/making-a-nietzsche/blob/master/nbs/GPT2-Large%20-%20Day%202%20-%20More%20friendly%20experiments%20-%20maybe%20impressive.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes \n",
    "_We were unable to make the large model work on Kaggle, as it just runs out of disk space._ \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to post a functional version on Kaggle, we are commenting the `gpt2-large` executions :( , but a fully executed notebook with the output is available [**here**](https://github.com/dataista0/making-a-nietzsche/blob/master/nbs/GPT2-Large%20-774M-%20with%20Pytorch%20-%20Not%20that%20impressive.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Running it on a [`p2xlarge`](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/) instance on AWS works fine (1 GPU, 4 cores). Also, if you are running this version on Kaggle, remember to turn on the Internet and the GPU. You can find the toggle dropping down the Settings tab on your right  ==> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Comments on the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't get impressive human-like results with the large model in an out-of-the-box set-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various potential reasons for this:\n",
    "* The large model is not as good as the huge one. We can see a difference between the small, medium and large versions, so it's possible that the 1.5B parameters model is just out-of-the-box much better than the large one.\n",
    "* There may be some tweaks that improve the output (we are not too familiar with the topic, we are just jumping in with this notebook, so maybe some obvious tricks could improve the GPT-2 results a lot. Currently, we are working on a second notebook trying with top-k sampling, generating various results and manually picking the bes ones.\n",
    "* We may be missing something huge, like wrong tokenization. Please, if you find some error in the code, leave a comment!\n",

    "## The GPT-2, _February, 2019_\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 6 months ago, Open AI published [Better Language Models and Their Implications](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/). In the article, GPT-2, a large deep network with new impressing text-generation capabilities is presented, and some *amazing* human-like generated text examples are shown. They trained 4 different sizes and they released the pre-trained weights for the small and medium versions, keeping the large and huge ones private and calling for a public debate around the social impact of the new human ability to produce machine-generated text of human-like quality.\n",

    "\n",
    ">Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.\n",
