    "In this notebook we will run the recently release and ported GPT2 large pytorch version on the samples shown in the original blogpost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally ran an *out-of-the-box zero-shot experiment* obtaining not that impressing results in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/gpt2-large-774m-w-pytorch-not-that-impressive/) notebook (also [here](https://github.com/dataista0/making-a-nietzsche/blob/master/nbs/GPT2-Large%20-774M-%20with%20Pytorch%20-%20Not%20that%20impressive.ipynb) in github). \n",

    "In this notebook we will have an opossite experimentation approach, **making it easy for the model to show its best face**.  We will post-process the generated text removing trivial problems and generate various samples and manually pick the best ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the results with that perspective later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimentation framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do the following:\n",
    "* Run 10 trials with some parameters for different inputs\n",
    "* Manually remove repeated sequences.\n",
    "* Ignore results which are shorter than certain threshold (33% the original requested amount of words in the first experiment, less than an absolute value in the second one)\n",
    "* Manually pick the best generated texts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the post processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing repeated sequences seems a fair thing to do, since it's a solvable issue - trivially solvable - and it doesn't compromise the big picture. Repeating information is a problem of second level compared to generating coherent speech, since removing the repetitions is something we can trivially do with a post-filter. Although this filter can be done at generation time, we are doing it _a posteriori_ for simplicity of implementation (but it takes more time). Also, we are removing the last uncompleted sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of the aplication of this rule is the following output from the experiment with the WW2 paragraph, take a look at how this problem affect the perception about coherence:\n",

      "INPUT: World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.[1][2][3][4]\n",
      "OUTPUT  2: The war began in Europe and continued in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The Allied powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France—were able to achieve victory thanks to the superior technology of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain. The German and Japanese armies were defeated by the Allies, and the Axis powers were defeated by the Allies. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which divided the world into two superpowers: the United States of America and the Soviet Union.World War II was the longest and bloodiest war in history. The Allied forces were able to defeat the Axis powers in the battle of the Atlantic Ocean, but the war was ended when the United States launched the atomic bomb on Japan. The war was also the deadliest conflict in history, with more than 100 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.A total of five major conflicts occurred during the war:The Great War (1939–1945)The Second World War (1945–1953)The Korean War (1950–1953)The Vietnam War (1954–1975)The Cold War (1973–1991)The Cold War was the longest and bloodiest war in history. The Soviet Union and China were the primary antagonists of the Cold War, with the United States and the Soviet Union often fighting one another. The Cold War was a period of conflict between the superpowers, with the United States and the Soviet Union often fighting one another.The Cold War began in the early 1950s, when the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. The Soviet Union also began a massive expansion of its nuclear arsenal, which it used to threaten the United States and other Western powers. The United States and the Soviet Union fought a war of words, with the United States accusing the Soviet Union of developing nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union accusing the United States of developing ballistic missiles. The Cold War was a time of intense political and economic tensions between the superpowers. The United States and the Soviet Union were at odds over the Cold War, with the United States trying to maintain its dominance in the world, and the Soviet Union trying to maintain its influence in the world. The Cold War brought great economic benefits to the United States, including the creation of the American economy, the creation of the United States Space Agency, and the creation of the United States Space Command.The Cold War was the first major conflict between superpowers, and it was a significant factor in the formation of the United Nations (UN). The Cold War was also the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union, which was the primary antagonist of the Cold War. The Cold War was the most destructive war in history.The Cold War was the longest and bloodiest war in history.\n",

Poland, a country of approximately 10 million people, was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1939. The Nazi invasion was preceded by a series of acts of aggression against the country that included the forced deportation of over 6 million Poles to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was able to hold onto the Polish territories for several years, but the occupation of Poland was an initial blow to the Soviet Union and the United States as the Soviet Union's most important ally in the war.The Soviet Union and the United States were both directly involved in the war, but the Soviet Union was defeated and the United States was able to retain its territories and control over the Pacific.The Second World War [ edit ]The Soviet Union and the United States both contributed to the war effort.

The invasion was initiated by the German Army of the Wehrmacht, which was commanded by Adolf Hitler. The invasion began with the German Army, commanded by General Franz Halder, advancing through the Polish capital of Warsaw. The invasion was initially unsuccessful, as the Polish Army was able to repel the German advance. The German Army was able to make a number of breakthroughs, including the capture of Warsaw. The invasion of Poland was the first major war in which the Soviet Union was directly involved.

Wootton, a professor of biology at the University of Oxford. \"We hope that this finding will help to explain the remarkable diversity of the animal kingdom, and that it will help us to understand why such animals are so rare.\"Wootton and his colleagues were conducting research in the Andes Mountains in Peru, when they discovered a herd of unicorns living in a valley called Cerro Torre.\"We were surprised to find a herd of unicorns in a valley that is not inhabited by any other animals,\" Wootton said. \"We were also surprised that the animals were able to speak English, a language that is not spoken in the wild.

In this form of communication, the animals mimic sounds that they hear in the wild, and they also use this communication to communicate with one another.\"Vocal mimicry is a form of communication that involves the use of vocal sounds that are produced by animals in the wild,\" Wootton said. \"Vocal mimicry is a very effective means of communication because it is not limited to the use of vocal sounds that are produced by animals. In addition, vocal mimicry is a very efficient way of communication because it is not limited to the use of sounds produced by animals. Instead, vocal mimicry is used to communicate with other animals, and it is used to communicate with humans as well.\"The researchers then used a microphone to record the sounds produced by the animals. These sounds were then translated into English and played back to the animals.\"We heard a lot of different sounds,\" Wootton said. \"We heard the animals talking and laughing, and we also heard them talking about something that was not in the wild. We heard the animals talking about the weather, and about things that they had seen in the wild.\"The researchers then used a computer program to analyze the sounds the animals were making. The computer program was able to translate the sounds into English, and the researchers were able to find out that the animals were using vocal mimicry to communicate with one another.\"Vocal mimicry is a very effective form of communication because it is not limited to the use of vocal sounds that are produced by animals,\" Wootton said. \"In addition, vocal mimicry is a very efficient way of communication because it is not limited to the use of sounds produced by animals.\"The researchers are now working to determine how the animals communicate, and how they communicate with humans.\"We will have to see how they communicate with us, and how we communicate with them,\" Wootton said. \"We are very interested in understanding how this communication works, and we are also interested in how we can use it to help conserve the species.\n",

It's one thing to talk about the possibility of a \"grand bargain\" that would include tax increases and spending cuts, and it's another to actually get down to the business of actually negotiating a deal.Well, the time has come. The House and Senate are set to begin negotiations on a budget deal on Wednesday, and the White House is said to be supportive of the approach.The key question, however, is whether the White House will actually support the approach, or whether the House and Senate will be so far apart that the White House will have to step in and veto the deal.It's a tricky situation, because the White House is already working behind the scenes to make sure that the House and Senate don't get the deal they want. The White House is working with the House leadership to ensure that the House passes a budget resolution that includes the revenue-raising provisions that the White House wants, and the Senate passes a budget resolution that includes the spending cuts that the White House wants.\n",
