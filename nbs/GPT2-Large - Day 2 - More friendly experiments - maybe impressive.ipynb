    "## This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will run the recently-released and ported GPT2 large pytorch version over the amples shown in the original blogpost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We originally ran an *out-of-the-box zero-shot experiment* obtaining not that impressing results in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/gpt2-large-774m-w-pytorch-not-that-impressive/) notebook (also [here](https://github.com/dataista0/making-a-nietzsche/blob/master/nbs/GPT2-Large%20-774M-%20with%20Pytorch%20-%20Not%20that%20impressive.ipynb) in github). \n",

    "In this notebook we will have an opossite experimentation approach, **making it easy for the model to show its best face**.  We will post-process the generated text removing trivial problems and generate various samples and manually pick the best ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are much better than in previous experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimentation framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do the following:\n",
    "* Run 10 trials with some parameters for different inputs\n",
    "* Remove repeated sentences and the uncompleted last one if any\n",
    "* Ignore results which are shorter than certain threshold (33% the original requested amount of words in the first experiment, less than an absolute value in the second one)\n",
    "* Manually pick the best generated texts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the post processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing repeated sequences seems a fair thing to do, since it's a solvable issue - trivially solvable - and it doesn't compromise the big picture. Repeating information is a problem of second level compared to generating coherent speech, since removing the repetitions is something we can trivially do with a post-filter. Although this filter can be done at generation time, we are doing it _a posteriori_ for simplicity of implementation (but it takes more time). Also, we are removing the last uncompleted sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of the aplication of this rule is the following output from the experiment with the WW2 paragraph, take a look at how this problem affect the perception about coherence:\n",

It is a mixture of the two languages, which is quite unusual,\" Dr. Evans told the BBC.In the study, the scientists looked at the genetic code of the unicorns to see if they could find any clues about their origin.

The researchers believe that the mutations are caused by the animals' environment.\"These unicorns are living in a remote and inhospitable environment, and the environment is probably quite different from what we would expect in the wild,\" Evans told the BBC.Evans believes that the unicorns' unique genetic mutations are likely to be an adaptation to their environment.\"We think that these mutations are an adaptation to their environment.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, and the issue of same-sex marriage has been a key issue in the presidential campaign. The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has opposed gay marriage, while President Obama has said he is open to it. The Supreme Court's decision came in a case in California. In 2012, the state's Supreme Court ruled that gay couples have the right to marry.In the case decided Monday, the court said the state cannot ban gay marriage. The justices ruled 5-4 that the state cannot ban same-sex marriage because it violates the constitutional right to marry. The court said the state's ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates against same-sex couples. The court also said that the constitution protects the right to marry.For more, we're joined by two guests. In Washington, D.C., we're joined by the attorney general of the District of Columbia, Eric H. Holder Jr., and in New York, we're joined by the attorney general of New York, Eric T.

However, the immune system of the human body is not the only organ that is affected by cortisol. The immune system also plays a crucial role in the formation of the blood plasma of the human body, in the development of the immune system, and in the regulation of the immune response. This review will focus on the effects of cortisol on the immune system in humans.Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It is secreted by the adrenal gland during periods of physical stress. Cortisol is released in response to the activation of the immune system.Cortisol is secreted by the adrenal glands during periods of physical stress.Cortisol is the main stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It is released in response to the activation of the immune system. In the body, cortisol is produced in two different forms: 1) free cortisol, which is released by the adrenals, and 2) glucocorticoids, which are produced by the liver. The glucocorticoids are secreted by the liver during periods of physical stress.The main role of the immune system in the development of the immune response is to protect the body from infection. The immune system can also play a role in the regulation of the immune response.The immune system is also involved in the regulation of the immune response.\n",
