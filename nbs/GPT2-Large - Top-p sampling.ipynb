      "INPUT: World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.

The war was fought on two fronts: the Western Front, which was the Western Hemisphere, and the Eastern Front, which was the Eastern Hemisphere. The Western Front was the front in which the Allied forces fought against the German army, while the Eastern Front was the front in which the Axis forces fought against the Allied forces. The war was also fought in the air, with the Allies using bombers and fighter planes to attack the German air force. The Allies also used submarines and mines to attack the German naval forces. The Allied forces were supported by the Soviet Union, which was supported by the Nazi Germany.The war was the result of the Allied victory in World War I, which had been won by the Allies in 1918. The Allies had been defeated in World War I by the German army, which had been defeated in World War I by the Soviet army. The Allied victory in World War I had led to the formation of the United Nations, which was formed by the victorious Allied powers in 1919. The United Nations was the first international organization to be created. The United Nations was created to provide a forum for international cooperation and peace.The war was the first major conflict of the Cold War, which was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union.

      "OUTPUT  1: The second world war that would become the modern world war was born in the Great Patriotic War, fought by Soviet troops in the east and the Axis forces in the west of Germany. Some major battles were won and lost on July 23rd, 1939, the birthday of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin; the Ottomans' Persian Gulf invasion took place on August 17th; two months later, on October 13th, a Bulgarian army assault on the Suez Canal resulted in a disastrous attempt to gain control of the canal. After the war, the Allies ruled most of Europe, leaving the Axis Powers in control of the eastern half of the continent, with Germany and Italy remaining in control of Central Europe and Italy.After the establishment of the Soviet Union, the war in Europe was declared over by the Soviet Union on November 11, 1945, as Germany capitulated to the USSR. In the west, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany remained separated, with each just a few hundred miles from each other. British, French, and American air forces and Navy medallions and navy ships from the four countries fought for victory, securing the rise of the United Nations and establishing the League of Nations. In the Soviet Union itself, the biggest military victory was the defeat of Germany, though that of Italy also scored one critical defeat. Both Britain and France declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, and both Western powers were formed in 1941. From then on, the Allied and Axis forces warred over every strategic region of the world, from China, Korea, and Central Asia to the Middle East and the Pacific Ocean, and even across the Atlantic Ocean.The first decade of the 1950s was the cold war in action. The Cold War was a decades-long war between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was waged against each other through both covert and overt operations. The Cold War was generally fought between the United States and the Soviet Union, but also included the battles of the Gulf War, the First Gulf War, the Gashat War (1971-1974), and the Vietnam War. Although the conflict was over in 1989, hostilities were not officially ended until 1990.A cold war wasn't just limited to military activity, though. The Cold War affected everything from the media landscape of each country to how much well-known groups were named in each country.The Cold War also affected people.\n",

      "OUTPUT  2: Most scholars believe that the initial use of nuclear weapons by the United States against Germany during the 1939–1945 Korean War was aimed at creating a global nuclear deterrent to deter aggression from the Soviet Union. The motivation was not primarily to stop the German invasion but to ensure that Soviet policy towards Japan would change from assuming that it would be attacked first, after which Soviet aircraft would be directed against Japan to get the Japanese under control and create a strategic advantage for the Soviet Union against Germany. At the same time, nuclear weapons were clearly desirable for the purpose of psychological warfare: to make the American public believe that all German equipment and equipment in Europe was under Soviet control, and would therefore not be able to assist the United States against Germany. Many of the early cases of nuclear weapons use were part of this deception.[1] By late 1945, Japan was too weak to be invaded; the rationale that led to the use of nuclear weapons was used later on to justify other uses of nuclear weapons such as the Strategic Air Command's production of highly enriched uranium, the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, and the military use of napalm in Korea.[5]After the outbreak of the war, many major powers sought to acquire nuclear weapons for their own purposes and as a deterrent against future aggression, with the majority of countries committing themselves to this goal prior to the outbreak of hostilities. Some used nuclear weapons for research and development of new and improved weapons (also known as \"development\"), while others dropped bombs only in response to attacks, which made conventional weapons unnecessary.[1][2][3]As the war progressed, the Soviet Union was forced to strike first to protect its state as a means of deterring attack by German and Allied forces, and the Allies to send the best forces to capture Moscow and its citizens. Many allied leaders even insisted on a \"scramble and surprise\" operation where Soviet forces would go on the offensive while the combined forces of the British, Americans, and Canadians attempted to capture Paris. The United States and the Soviet Union both released their forces to attack each other, the Allies being able to engage enemy forces when the Soviets could not.[6]Germany was not initially prepared for an invasion. Having long-term treaties with France and the rest of Europe, Germany's military was weak and the country had little artillery, forcing its troops to rely on the airforce.\n",

      "OUTPUT  3: The 1940s-1970s are often designated as the \"Great Depression\" period of modern history due to a rising rate of poverty that lasted from 1933 to 1945 and which spread into industrial labor (and, indeed, into urban society), as well as falling economic and agricultural output and unemployment. The Great Depression itself began with the 1929 crash of the stock market and stock markets, beginning a broader deflationary trend across the nation that continued throughout the 1930s to the early 1960s, including the Depression of the 1930s and the Depression of the 1930s-1940s.The Great Depression impacted millions of American families and workers and brought an end to what had become the pre-war economic boom and created the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Although more extreme, such losses of wealth to the dollar came only gradually and had a much less catastrophic effect on the labor market and workers than those brought on-board by the war.[2][4]The mainstay of the country during the Great Depression was food. Every single American family could get by on food and shelter. Food prices were three to four times those in many European countries, as both government and private corporations underwrote companies that promised prices would not fall when the market suffered major disruption from the war, or if people preferred to eat less food.[4] Labor shortages made finding jobs near places that could harvest the food even more difficult, and production dropped to only a quarter of its usual rate in mid-1940.The Great Depression was exacerbated by the price policies imposed by the Roosevelt administration—for example, the order of what types of goods could be imported and how many (in 1934 only steel goods could be imported). Many large and successful business enterprises were crippled or changed substantially in response to these policies and practices. For example, Wagner Steel shut down manufacturing and shipping before the war. Its owner, Osborn B. Wagner, feared that if the country was unable to make its way through war expenses to pay for wartime materials and personnel then Wagner's heavy investment in factories to produce goods might be abandoned.[5]As the price of food rose steadily, fewer Americans were able to buy enough to feed themselves, resulting in hunger.When public demand for food was low, more and more young people were engaging in jobs that prepared them for a household job.\n",

      "OUTPUT  4: Background [ edit ]Russian railways and Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles.Beginning in 1939, the United States, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union conducted regular aerial bombing campaigns aimed at destroying enemy planes at any cost.[5] The aim of these raids was to completely destroy the enemy's ability to fly, or to destroy a sufficient number of its military forces, thus guaranteeing victory and ensuring the penetration of the offensive.[6] On 2 July 1939, US Army General George S. Patton announced an initiative that went to utter war: to \"go over to the ground as fast as we can, and make the fight hard and even bloody\". The Marshall Plan was established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, authorizing the United States to hand over $100 billion of its war funds to Western nations that had not already put their hands up in support of the Axis.[7]At the time of the American invasion of Europe in May 1940, the European war had been launched seven times in two and a half years, and the Red Army had managed to capture seven of the eight points of the German–Polish–Belarusian front. The German army only had to capture the four other \"invasion\" points before the Red Army would fully occupy the Eastern half of Europe.But the British, French, and United States were in no hurry to employ this game plan, and, instead of just taking over the frontlines, they proceeded to siege (summon) the German East Prussian frontier city of Winterthur and ravaged the enemy's eastern front. Meanwhile, they rapidly re-shipped and advanced through the Soviet bloc, captured several towns in the south and conquered the oil and rubber-producing region of Transnistria.[8]By summer 1940, the German-Russian invasion was in full swing. Four German divisions led by General Wilhelm Keitel had penetrated through the Red Army. The vast majority of German troops under Adolf Hitler were in their own territory and thus were not subject to the Red Army's occupation. Only eight independent divisions from the Red Army, which included the largest armored force ever sent in to battle, were confined to their homelands, awaiting orders from Hitler.[9]The outbreak of World War II caused by an Axis alliance did not come until October 1939.\n",

      "OUTPUT  5: Timeline [ edit ]The Second World War in years.Great Powers [ edit ]As a global military alliance, the Allied and Axis powers fought alongside one another in both major theaters of war and the occupation of European, Asian, and Pacific countries. The war in Europe began in June 1939, and the war in Asia began in December 1939, and the final conflict ended with Germany's surrender in April 1945.The main theaters of conflict in the conflict were Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. During the Second World War, most military targets of concern were strategic or industrial cities or infrastructure. Militarily, the major combatants were the Allies: Germany and the United Kingdom; Japan and the United States; and France and Italy.AfricaEuropean and North Africa were, for the most part, ignored by Western powers and ignored by the Axis powers. The Japanese Empire was not a political entity with land that could fall under control of Japan (land in Africa included most of modern Ghana, where Japan had been fighting British and French troops since 1871). Neither the Allies nor the Axis cared to liberate the vast African continent. They ignored it as a resource of potential use to U.S. and British imperial interests. This lack of interest led to the infamous \"Wog War,\" where many African nations were systematically annihilated.The relationship between Britain and France grew unstable after the Second World War and became increasingly hostile. After the bombings of London, France started bombing Allied merchant ships along the North African coast. British and French forces fought in the Six-Day War in June 1948, and Britain was reintegrated into the United Nations as a former colonial power. France made numerous invasions into North Africa. The tensions between the Allies and the Axis, however, was not eased until 1954. Following the fall of the Egyptian monarchy, the United States was seriously involved in the affairs of Africa.[5][6] On 6 November 1953, the United States declared a military occupation of both Algeria and Morocco.[7] The American military presence spread throughout Western Sahara, and American security forces occupied this territory, regardless of the wishes of the Moroccan Government of General Mohammed V. Umar. In Algeria, it was the Americans that first occupied the desert-city of Douentza and tried to establish the Unified Islamic State of Algeria (UIA).\n",

      "OUTPUT  1: 'Fantastical'A team of Colombian scientists from Universidad National de Colombia, U.S. Forest Service and Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, has just discovered two free-ranging, 5,000-year-old herds of foraging unicorns in the remote Vazquez Montane National Park in the Andes Mountains, a sanctuary which also includes spectacular, extinct megafauna such as the British mammoth.This recently revealed magical forest is more exotic than any we've seen before, said UNC's Stephan Wilson. And not just in the sense that we hadn't thought of it before. It seems to be the first place on the planet where unicorn pups can be born, during a time period that spans several millennia.\"This place seems far from settled,\" he explained in a press release. \"The absence of most modern household appliances means the stables aren't impressive, the close quarters made of concrete and concrete slab mean that the horses are left exposed, the tunnels of the hydroelectric dam [at the park] don't look like recreation ground, and the mining sector (which we suspect includes radioactive metals) cannot make their presence felt.\"An eco-tourism ministry reported there are 400 and growing in the area, and Wilson suggests that the only way to find out more about their origins and the animals they are now maintaining is to set out for the park. In the meantime, he points out that even animals as exotic as the two herders have a name — sheep unicorn, or milk unicorn for short.WATCH: Amazing footage of the Raptors full of actionWhat makes the unicorn unusual?An 8,500-kilometre-long pure-white, cloudless sky composed of unfathomable clouds, the sky over this location is almost like nothing we have ever seen.

John Kasich asked him to respond to a series of criticisms of his administration.The governor, he says, told him that he had adopted some of his past positions and now wanted to clarify.In addition to spelling out Kasich's past positions on abortion, abortion providers, gay rights and school segregation, the letter contains a brief description of the centerpiece of Kasich's platform: the Ohio Promise.The 23-word article begins: \"John Kasich took the state from a period of economic downturn and financial collapse to the forefront of a modern manufacturing and energy economy.\"He continues: \"Through careful planning and creative money management, he established incentives for small businesses, laid the groundwork for higher wages and increased investment in public services, and allowed Ohioans to make significant investments in education, research and medical research, environmental protection and the environment.\"The article continues: \"At the same time, Mr. Kasich enacted significant reforms in education and federal programs, such as Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. While efforts to raise taxes have fallen short of expectations, over the past six years Ohioans have witnessed a historic resurgence of economic vitality.\"The suggestion that Kasich has gone soft on business contradicts a recent \"fact-checking\" op-ed by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, which attacked Kasich on \"red\" and \"blue\" fronts.\n",

The radar picks up small ice crystals in the mountain lakes and ponds, allowing the scientists to see the land across the overlying ice surface.\"It was surprising to discover unicorns living in a place such as this,\" Velie said. \"This is not something you would have expected. It's not the sort of thing you would expect to be able to survive in. But it is, and that's fantastic.\"The study led by Velie and researcher Dr. Anjali Alakhubova, a postdoctoral fellow at Virginia, has been published in the journal Nature.Velvet, who described the team's findings as \"terrifying,\" said they hope to help other animal species evolve into languages to communicate with each other.\"It shows how important a language might be for an animal, in fact,\" Velie said.First discovered by Italian explorer and explorer-in-training Giovanni da Verrazzano in the 16th century, the rarity of unicorns in the wild has puzzled researchers for decades. In a paper published in the February 2014 issue of The Journal of Mammalogy, Velie and colleagues identified 15 unicorns, but Velie conceded that this number could represent \"only a fraction of the current population.\"But the researchers said the technology was powerful enough to detect the animals during the survey. They even chose to locate the animals based on their natural range.\"This was a new species being discovered by non-experts,\" Velie said. \"The animals were spotted on their own turf and were unmarked by any satellite or other surveillance system.\"First spotted by a Spanish guide, Velie said the animals also inhabited an area called Atunya, on Peru's Bajo de la Cumbre mountains, a mountain range that extends for at least 1,000 miles.\n",

It is the only large land animal known to use language.The Santa Elena Volcano is believed to have covered two areas with lava – one is an Alpine valley, and the other, which was dubbed Cuiabá, is a rather interesting landscape. The remote area is inhabited by a kind of fur-bearing horse, Narrowmoor ponies, and the wolves that roam the jungle.Dr Lynne Grafton, from the University of Glasgow, UK, first started thinking about the unicorns after seeing their unusual appearance during an overnight visit in 2006. \"A guidebook given to visitors to the town told of an extremely rare sight: a herd of unicorns, about three yards tall, seen across from the volcanic crater Cuiabá,\" she said.\"So when I went on holiday I was fascinated by the chance to see them. But my amazement quickly turned to surprise as the animals were hidden in such a remote part of the volcano's crater. It is so beautiful. I saw that we had stumbled on a fascinating landscape. I was so amazed at the beauty of the area.\"Researchers from the University of Manchester found out that they had stumbled upon some unusual fauna when they researched the temperature and moisture patterns of water and soil around the soil where the unicorns were found.The scientists decided to send a team of scientists into the Tashkent area on a guided tour, and drove to Cuiabá. When they arrived, they knew that their call would be heard.In fact, the unicorns did speak. \"The horses moved their trunks, stalked, and even wept,\" Dr Grafton said. The unicorns were also a great threat to the horses, which had an interest in the unicorns' silky hair.Although the unicorns would eat grass, the horses only grazed around trees and shrubs. \"If the horse had to graze on these plants it was possible the horse would bite off a branch and maybe leave a small puncture wound, like a bite wound,\" Dr Grafton explained.\n",

Shape Created with Sketch. 12 of the world's weirdest animals 1/12 Spiders The world is full of interesting, weird and wonderful animals. But spiders are the weirdest of the bunch. Most spiders can be classified as either nocturnal or nocturnal-active. Nocturnal spiders, like the famous jumping spider (pictured above), may use sound to navigate by communicating with other spiders. And, yes, they do have webbed legs. But a group of spiders living in captivity took this idea to the next level and decided to stick webs across the ceiling, to catch sound coming in from above. \"We call it spider-sky,\" biologist Kentaro Miura of the University of Tokyo explained to Live Science. \"Rather than using pitch for navigation, these spiders find a way to make sounds from above and then manipulate the sound to create very interesting images that we can't get from recording spiders normally.\" 2/12 Spider (Orb weaver) Orb weavers are not the most sophisticated of arachnids. Instead of fur, they have compound eyes with four pairs of eardrum-like parts, each containing about 1,000 light-sensitive cells. The photosynthetic spiders don't use sound to find food, but instead store sound waves on tiny hair-like projections called trapnose cells. This leads to the spiders' spectacularly loud calls. Once in a while, however, a spider will actually spit out sound waves when disturbed. Those waves can be used to tell other spiders when a predator is nearby, which helps it to avoid being eaten by that particular prey item. 3/12 Snakes But it's not just snakes that seem to enjoy sound. Salamanders, for example, can produce different sounds when frightened. And when it comes to ugly ones, there are arachnids that are just hideous.\n",

We haven't been to all of them, but what we've found at other sites in the forest is something quite spectacular: they've all had central poles, upright poles, without stones or other, in other words, the rhino-horns because we know that most of them have rhino horns.\"The study concluded that \"having rhino horns is a feature of adult male litters and apparently of all babies born here.\"Now, that would seem to contradict the notion that all unicorns belong to Indian tribes. Or is it? There are perhaps a couple of possible explanations for the universality of unicorns. One possible reason that a single herd can grow quite a number of adult unicorns is the many species of Indian bulls. Unicorns' black pigment also makes them extremely hard to identify.In fact, Peebles says the only way that the animals have been completely identified would be by being seized by the animals themselves, and at that point they would probably agree to be destroyed or buried to preserve their unique genetic diversity. Perhaps they don't get as many attacks. Perhaps their DNA doesn't do all that much damage to the other animals living around them.Or maybe it's in the Indian bull's DNA that he gets carried away with the horn?[The Telegraph]<|endoftext|>Her novel received the 2014 Doubleday Literary Award.Thomas Ligotti is the author of critically acclaimed fiction that has been published in more than fifty languages, including the New York Times, BBC, National Geographic, the New Yorker, as well as several books of poetry and short fiction.\n",

We suspect their vocalizations also include gestures and they use the familiar and familiar devices in their way of communicating.\"The study group, composed of researchers and wildlife managers from countries such as Venezuela and Ecuador, made the following findings:In addition to teaching English to the unicorns, a team of scientists spent many hours communicating with the animals by email, telephone, and on foot. It was all in an effort to establish their 'language'The researchers also got to spend time with the unicorns during the more typical days when they would wander around their vast territoryWhen the scientists decided to study the creatures, they would typically begin by searching for their caves in the mountains, but would then begin recording their social behavior. The only time they would not attempt to observe the animals is if there was a threat to them.According to the researchers, the animals are all native to Central America, and about 1,000 have been spotted since the 1960s in the Andes.After capturing the unicorns for their study, the team spent countless hours tracking them using GPS to get a sense of where they had traveled in order to locate the animals' caves and to make sure that they stayed in one place. Travis emphasized the importance of living off the land, as these large animals are protected by law.\"Wild animals are very difficult to study for the type of work we're doing. We are attempting to create one of the most complex and detailed studies of this group that the world has ever seen,\" said Richard Travis.To listen to the speech sounds of the unicorns, listen to the article below.RACE VS.

Image: @brojempwIt turns out that white men have enjoyed more money, total time spent, and total money spent, at bars that serve non-white clients than bartenders that are of other ethnicities. Just 28 percent of white bargoers polled agreed that a bartender should not be the bartender of choice if the house's menu offers three or more of each of the two main entrees. It's true that, out of 12,324 respondents who said that their household income was over $100,000 in 2012, respondents who responded to the study were overwhelmingly white men. But among those respondents, only 8 percent were black, 11 percent were Hispanic, and 5 percent were Asian. In other words, white men have been successfully keeping jobs at these establishments in spite of being bartenders, even though they also provided the majority of service to their non-white customers.Tracy Ryan is the executive director of the NGO \"The SoHo Business Review\" and runs a blog called \"Entertainment Nation.\" He told BuzzFeed News that white men have always been the people who tend to serve non-white customers. However, they haven't always been as confident in their abilities to serve them and offer the best customer service. In the 1950s, when Ryan was a manager at Peter Pan bar on West End Avenue in Lower Manhattan, white men dominated the bar, and they weren't afraid to admit it: \"It's one of those things that it's not really something that the white men really like to talk about,\" Ryan said.\n",

A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.
